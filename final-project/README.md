# **FP1 \- Proposal for Critique**

## Idea Sketches

### *Idea 1: Portfolio in React*

The purpose of this would be to create an improved version of my existing portfolio in React, adding more interactive elements, scroll/text effects, and smoother transitions. I plan to check contrast, navigation, and code structure to ensure accessibility in my design. On my portfolio, I would like to convey the process and final result of four projects, an about page, and a captivating home screen. Some design concerns I have are: How much interaction is too much? How do I use animations in ways that don’t take away from the actual content?


### *Idea 2: Emotions Wheel*

Aligned with my passion for mental health education and skill-building, I want to create an interactive site that teaches emotional granularity, using an animated radial menu to display the wheel. Clicking on an emotion displays more information such as definitions, examples, coping strategies, exercises, journaling prompts, and more media. Such information will be relevant to each emotion so users can gain a solid understanding of the complexities of granular emotions. I plan to use high contrast and simple information architecture for accessibility. A design concern I have is: How might I make this experience unique, educational, and entertaining?


### *Idea 3: Gratitude Wall*

Gratitude is an important skill and major factor in overall well-being, so with this interface, I aim to encourage people to take note of what they’re grateful for in a visual format that they can always return to. It will utilize local storage and infinite scroll interactions. Notes of gratitude will be organized in a loose grid and incorporate various media: photos, writing, audio, videos, etc. To increase accessibility, I will make navigation clear and visual/cognitive load as low as possible. Some design concerns I have are: With an infinite canvas, how can I prioritize navigation? How will the notes be grouped/categorized/sorted?


## Feedback Summary

For the portfolio project, feedback focused on relevance and scope. Since I already have a relatively interactive site live, it may not be necessary or as valuable to code it from scratch. It also may not be feasible to code all projects due to scope and time constraints. Katie and Naimah suggested refining the project selection to highlight only the most relevant or impactful projects, as this could streamline development and enhance focus. Naimah also recommended prioritizing specific projects to help keep the project within a manageable scope.

The emotions wheel idea drew similar feedback from classmates regarding data needs. Chance and Katie both raised the importance of having a dataset to support the wheel’s function, especially if it includes emotional resources. They suggested finding an external dataset if creating a new one is impractical and too time-consuming. Katie and Naimah also pointed out that including a journaling feature could make the emotions wheel more complex, which might necessitate narrowing the scope. They advised considering whether additional complexity aligns with the overall project goals.

For the gratitude wall, several people raised design and technical considerations. Chance questioned how low data volume might affect the wall’s interactivity and user experience. Katie and Naimah both emphasized the need for user control over customization and navigation; users should have the ability to change colors or decide the grouping of notes. The concept of an infinite canvas also brought up questions about navigation and accessibility. Naimah suggested considering an infinite scroll or drag-and-drop library to facilitate usability.


## Feedback Digestion

In the lab, the feedback on the emotions wheel project highlighted considerations around complexity, usability, and data sets, which are valuable as I refine the design.

One prominent point was the need for a dataset to support emotional resources, as both Chance and Katie noted that relying on external data could streamline development and ensure that users receive accurate, relevant information. I’ll prioritize this critique by exploring existing emotion lexicons or datasets like the NRC Emotion Lexicon, which could allow users to access information relevant to their emotions without developing a new dataset from scratch. Using a dataset will simplify the design, ensure consistent information, and avoid overcomplicating the wheel’s functionality with potentially unmanageable features.

Another key critique focused on scope. Katie and Naimah pointed out that incorporating a journaling aspect might add complexity and shift the wheel away from its core focus. Given this feedback, I will keep journaling optional or avoid it entirely in the initial version to maintain focus on the primary interactive elements. This way, I can ensure a clean, engaging experience that educates users about emotions without overwhelming the interface with extra features.

A final area of feedback was about user experience and interaction. Katie and Naimah raised accessibility and usability concerns, especially around scrolling elements. I’m intrigued by the idea of an interactive wheel that could use smooth transitions or simple animations to engage users and convey information in an entertaining way. This would keep navigation intuitive and visually engaging without introducing navigational challenges, particularly for mobile users.

Ultimately, this feedback aligns with my goal of creating an educational, interactive, and well-scoped emotions wheel that is manageable to develop and enjoyable for users.
